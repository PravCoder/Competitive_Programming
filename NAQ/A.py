KATTIS

Problem:
-Each card has value
-Add card: increase total score by cards value
-Multiply card: multiply score by cards value
process cards left to right, compute score for a row of cards.


Input:
n=number of cards, 
k=maximum number of multiply cards you can use. 
next n lines contain either a or m and an int v.

a=add cards
m=multiply cards
v=value of card

Output:
for each n output lines output max score you can get for a subseq
of length at most 1,2,3,...,n.
