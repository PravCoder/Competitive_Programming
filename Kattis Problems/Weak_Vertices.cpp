Problem: Weak Vertices https://open.kattis.com/problems/weakvertices

Input: 
is a single graph, which starts with integer n the number of verticies in the graph.
Next n lines have n integers, which in total represent n-by-n adj-matrix. n is number of vertices in graph.
Each line is a row in adj-mat, there are n columns
